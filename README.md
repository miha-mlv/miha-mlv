# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ‘¨About Me  
My name is Mikhail Malorodov, I am 20 years old, and I am a novice Android developer. I am attracted to the elegance of Java and Kotlin languages in this area, as well as the demand for Android solutions.
I strive to write stable, maintainable and scalable code. I do not have any teamwork experience yet, but I am open to cooperation and hope to try myself in a team soon.
As a beginner, I am constantly learning â€” every day my knowledge becomes deeper and more structured.

## ðŸ“šEducation
I am currently a third-year student pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at the Moscow Institute of Radio Engineering, Electronics, and Automation (MIREA).
